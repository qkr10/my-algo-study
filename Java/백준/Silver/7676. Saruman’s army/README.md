### 문제 설명

<p>Saruman the White must lead his army along a straight path from Isengard to Helm’s Deep. To keep track of his forces, Saruman distributes seeing stones, known as palantirs, among the troops. Each palantir has a maximum effective range of R units, and must be carried by some troop in the army (i.e., palantirs are not allowed to “free float” in mid-air). Help Saruman take control of Middle Earth by determining the minimum number of palantirs needed for Saruman to ensure that each of his minions is within R units of some palantir.</p>

### 입력 

 <p>The input test file will contain multiple cases. Each test case begins with a single line containing an integer R, the maximum effective range of all palantirs (where 0 ≤ R ≤ 1000), and an integer n, the number of troops in Saruman’s army (where 1 ≤ n ≤ 1000). The next line contains n integers, indicating the positions x<sub>1</sub>, . . ., x<sub>n</sub> of each troop (where 0 ≤ x<sub>i</sub> ≤ 1000). The end-of-file is marked by a test case with R = n = −1.</p>

### 출력 

 <p>For each test case, print a single integer indicating the minimum number of palantirs needed.</p>
